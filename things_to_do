things to take care of:

== class page ==

- restrictions
	*tomorrow*
	- test addition/deletion

== object property page ==

- "inverse functional" -> 1 line (low priority)
- multiple domains and ranges?

== data property page ==

- make adding/editing subproperties, superproperties, eqproperties, domain, range work
- use setRangeDatatypeURI for range
	- figure out a list of XML schema datatypes
- remove + when changing using updateData (check this for object property as well)
- add class option data
- showing super/sub/eq properties still not working. why?

Problems still remaining:

- adding restrictions. why aren't they persisting?
- using setRangeDatatypeURI for range: how to get a list of these datatype URIs for presentation to the user in autocomplete?
- problem with "cannot convert to OntProperty" error

- edit data domain
- edit data range
- delete data domain
- delete data range
- check to see if setRangeEntityURI() does the right thing
- get the range from the entity uri
