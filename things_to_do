things to take care of:

== class page ==

- talk to Jim about whether super/sub relationship should be symmetric in backend (why isn't it?)
- wider select box
- restrictions

== object property page ==

- fix "inverse functional" -> 1 line
- talk to Jim about multiple domains and ranges
- similar issue as classes with symmetric super/sub relationship

== data property page ==

- make adding/editing subproperties, superproperties, eqproperties, domain, range work
- more distinct shade of green for dataproperty
- use setRangeDatatypeURI for range
	- figure out a list of XML schema datatypes
- similar hierarchy
- wider select box
