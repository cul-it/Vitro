things to take care of:

== class page ==

- talk to Jim about whether super/sub relationship should be symmetric in backend (why isn't it?)

== object property page ==

- fix "inverse functional" -> 1 line
- create hierarchy in following way:
	- get list of all object properties
	- iterate through list, checking if not subproperty of anything
	- if so, add to new list (is a top property)
	- create tree hierarchy for each item in the new list
- talk to Jim about multiple domains and ranges
- similar issue as classes with symmetric super/sub relationship
- wider select box

== class property page ==

- make adding/editing subproperties, superproperties, eqproperties, domain, range work
- more distinct shade of green for dataproperty
- use setRangeDatatypeURI for range
	- figure out a list of XML schema datatypes
- similar hierarchy
- wider select box
